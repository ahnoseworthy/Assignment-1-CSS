        <h3>Official Lyrics</h3>
        <p>Just 'cause he liked your old picture
            Don't mean he's stuck on the past
            Just 'cause he talks to your brother
            Don't mean he's still attached
            Just 'cause he's drunk at 2 a.m.
            Texts, "Hey, what's up, girl, how you been?"
            Don't read too much into that
            Don't mean he wants you back
            If he loved you, he would tell you
            If he missed you, he would call
            If he wants you to meet his momma
            Then he would bring you home
            Oh, there ain't no excuse
            He ain't Mr. Misunderstood
            Quit lying to yourself
            If he wanted to, he would
            If he wanted to, he would
            Just 'cause he said "Happy Birthday"
            Don't waste a wish on him
            Don't psychoanalyze him
            Make it more than what it is
            He won't suddenly be the somebody
            You wish he always was
            If he didn't, then he doesn't
            If he wouldn't, then he wasn't
            If he loved you, he would tell you
            If he missed you, he would call
            If he wants you to meet his momma
            Then he would bring you home
            Oh, there ain't no excuse
            He ain't Mr. Misunderstood
            Quit lying to yourself
            If he wanted to, he would
            If he wanted to, he would
            He might've set the bar low
            But keep your standards high
            Ain't telling you nothing you don't know
            You know he ain't worth your time
            If he loved you, he would tell you
            If he missed you, he would call
            If he wants you to meet his momma
            Then he would bring you home
            Oh, there ain't no excuse
            He ain't Mr. Misunderstood
            Quit lying to yourself
            If he wanted to, he would
            If he wanted to, he would (if he wanted to, he would)
            If he wanted to, he would (if he wanted to, he would)
            If he wanted to, he would (if he wanted to, he would)
            If he wanted to, he would</p>

        <h3>About The Song</h3>
        <p>The song is based upon a women reflecting on an ex-partner occasionally reaching out to her or being friendly in conversation with them. This brings upon a mental debate on whether or not their ex-partner still holds romantic feelings toward them. Though, contrary to the women's thoughts, the lyrics suggest that those actions don't necessarily mean that he wants her back. That if that was really the case, that he really wanted her back, there would be a clear effort to show that he wants her back with no doubts or misconceptions. The song lyrics go about encouraging women to keep their standards high and recognize that he isn't worth their time if he doesn't make a meaningful effort to be with you. </p>
